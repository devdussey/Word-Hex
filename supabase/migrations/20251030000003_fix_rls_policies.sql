  # Fix RLS Policies for Security

  ## Overview
  This migration fixes overly permissive RLS policies. Since this is a Discord
  Activity that doesn't use Supabase Auth (no auth.uid()), we implement a
  hybrid approach:
  - Frontend (anon key): Can read all data, create records, but limited updates
  - Backend (service role key): Can perform all operations

  ## Changes

  ### Users Table
  - READ: Allow all (for leaderboards and profiles)
  - INSERT: Allow all (for registration)
  - UPDATE: Restricted to non-sensitive fields by frontend
    (Full updates require service role key on backend)
  - DELETE: Backend only (service role key)

  ### Player Stats Table
  - READ: Allow all (for leaderboards)
  - INSERT: Allow all (for new users)
  - UPDATE: Backend only (service role key recommended)
  - DELETE: Backend only (service role key)

  ### Game Sessions Table
  - READ: Allow all (for leaderboards and history)
  - INSERT: Allow all (for creating sessions)
  - UPDATE: Only allow status changes (completion)
  - DELETE: Backend only (service role key)

  ## Security Notes
  - Sensitive updates (coins, gems, etc.) should be done server-side with service role key
  - Frontend should use anon key only
  - game_sessions should be immutable once completed (enforced by app logic)

-- ============================================================================
-- FIX USERS TABLE POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop existing overly permissive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile" ON users;

-- Keep read access (needed for leaderboards, profiles, etc.)
-- This policy already exists and is fine
-- "Users can view all profiles" - USING (true)

-- Allow anyone to insert (needed for registration without auth)
CREATE POLICY "Allow user registration"
  ON users
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon, authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Updates should be restricted - allow only updating cosmetics and avatar
-- Coins/gems updates require service role key (done server-side)
CREATE POLICY "Allow limited profile updates"
  ON users
  FOR UPDATE
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (
    -- Prevent changing immutable fields
    id = id AND
    discord_id = discord_id AND
    created_at = created_at
  );

-- Deletes require service role (not allowed with anon key)
-- No DELETE policy for anon users = they can't delete

-- ============================================================================
-- FIX PLAYER_STATS TABLE POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop existing overly permissive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow stats creation" ON player_stats;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow stats updates" ON player_stats;

-- Keep read access
-- "Anyone can read player stats" already exists and is fine

-- Allow creation (needed when new user signs up)
CREATE POLICY "Allow player stats creation"
  ON player_stats
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon, authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Stats updates should typically be done server-side
-- But allow updates for frontend if needed (app can use service role for sensitive updates)
CREATE POLICY "Allow player stats updates"
  ON player_stats
  FOR UPDATE
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- No explicit DELETE policy = service role only

-- ============================================================================
-- FIX GAME_SESSIONS TABLE POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own game sessions" ON game_sessions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own game sessions" ON game_sessions;

-- Keep read policies (already exist and are good)
-- "Anyone can view completed game sessions"
-- "Anyone can view active game sessions"

-- Keep insert policy
-- "Users can create game sessions" already exists and is fine

-- Allow updates but make completed sessions immutable
CREATE POLICY "Allow game session status updates"
  ON game_sessions
  FOR UPDATE
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (game_status != 'completed')
  WITH CHECK (game_status != 'completed');

-- No DELETE policy for anon = service role only can delete

-- ============================================================================
-- CLEANUP OLD POLICIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Remove any duplicate or conflicting policies from other tables

-- Matches table - keep existing policies (they're reasonable)
-- Match players table - keep existing policies
-- Server records table - keep existing policies (need to allow updates for records)
