# Active Sessions Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Added the ability to view and join active game sessions in your Discord server. When players click "Play Now", they can see all ongoing games with player names, avatars, scores, and time remaining.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**New columns added to `game_sessions` table:**
- `server_id` (text) - Discord server/guild ID where the game is played
- `channel_id` (text) - Discord channel ID where the game is played
- `game_status` (text) - Status: 'active', 'completed', 'abandoned' (default: 'active')
- `round_number` (integer) - Current round in the game (default: 1)
- `time_remaining` (integer) - Seconds remaining in current round (default: 180)
- `player_avatar_url` (text) - Discord avatar URL for the player

**Indexes added for performance:**
- `idx_game_sessions_server_id` - Fast lookup by server
- `idx_game_sessions_game_status` - Filter by game status
- `idx_game_sessions_server_status` - Composite index for active sessions per server

**RLS Policy:**
- "Users can view active sessions in their server" - Allows viewing active games

---

### 2. ActiveSessionsList Component

**Location:** `/src/components/ActiveSessionsList.tsx`

**Features:**
- Real-time display of active game sessions
- Shows player avatar (Discord avatar or generated placeholder)
- Displays current score, time remaining, and word count
- Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Click any session to spectate/join

**UI Elements:**
- Player avatar (circular, 48x48px)
- Player name (bold, prominent)
- Score with trophy icon
- Time remaining with clock icon
- Round number
- Words found count
- Empty state when no active sessions

---

### 3. Updated LobbySelection Screen

**Changes:**
- New 3-column layout (2 columns for game modes, 1 for active sessions)
- Shows ActiveSessionsList on the right side
- Responsive design (stacks on mobile)
- Added "Back to Menu" button with arrow icon
- Accepts `serverId` prop to filter sessions by server

**Props Added:**
- `onJoinSession: (sessionId: string) => void` - Handle joining a session
- `serverId?: string` - Filter sessions by Discord server

---

### 4. Game Component Updates

**Session Creation:**
- Now saves `server_id` and `channel_id` on game start
- Sets `game_status` to 'active'
- Stores player's Discord avatar URL
- Initializes `round_number` and `time_remaining`

**Real-time Updates:**
- Updates `time_remaining` every 5 seconds during gameplay
- Marks session as 'completed' when game ends
- Updates continue to track score and words in real-time

**Props Added:**
- `serverId?: string` - Discord server ID (default: 'dev-server-123')
- `channelId?: string` - Discord channel ID (default: 'dev-channel-123')

---

### 5. App.tsx Integration

**New State:**
- `serverId` - Tracks current Discord server (default: 'dev-server-123' for dev mode)

**New Handler:**
- `handleJoinSession(sessionId)` - Navigate to game when joining active session

**Updated Props:**
- LobbySelection receives `serverId` and `onJoinSession`
- Game component receives `serverId`

---

## User Flow

### Starting a Game:
1. Click "Play" from main menu
2. See lobby selection screen with:
   - "Join Random" button
   - "Start Lobby" button
   - Active Sessions list (right side)
3. Active sessions show:
   - Player avatar and name
   - Current score
   - Time remaining
   - Round number
   - Words found
4. Click any active session to spectate/join
5. OR click "Start Lobby" to start your own game

### During Gameplay:
1. Session automatically created as 'active'
2. Updates to database every 5 seconds:
   - Time remaining
   - Score (on each word)
   - Words found (on each word)
   - Gems collected (on each word)
3. Other players in server see your active session
4. Session marked 'completed' when game ends

---

## Technical Details

### Real-time Synchronization

**Supabase Realtime:**
```typescript
const subscription = supabase
  .channel('active-sessions')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'game_sessions',
    filter: `server_id=eq.${serverId}`
  }, () => {
    loadActiveSessions();
  })
  .subscribe();
```

**Polling Fallback:**
- Refreshes every 5 seconds
- Ensures updates even if realtime fails

### Database Queries

**Load Active Sessions:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM game_sessions
WHERE server_id = 'xxx'
  AND game_status = 'active'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Update Time During Game:**
```sql
UPDATE game_sessions
SET time_remaining = <seconds>
WHERE id = 'xxx';
```

**Mark as Completed:**
```sql
UPDATE game_sessions
SET game_status = 'completed', time_remaining = 0
WHERE id = 'xxx';
```

## Avatar Handling

### Discord Avatars:
- Format: `https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/{user_id}/{avatar_hash}.png`
- Stored in `player_avatar_url` column
- Displayed at 48x48px with circular border

### Fallback Avatars:
- Generated using UI Avatars API
- Format: `https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name={player_name}&background=random`
- Automatically created if Discord avatar unavailable

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations:
- Indexed queries on `server_id` and `game_status`
- Composite index for `(server_id, game_status)`
- Limit results to 10 most recent sessions
- Update time only every 5 seconds (not every second)
- Efficient realtime subscriptions per server

### Database Load:
- Session creation: 1 INSERT per game
- During gameplay: ~12 UPDATEs per minute (time + word submissions)
- Game end: 1 UPDATE + leaderboard updates
- Viewing sessions: 1 SELECT every 5 seconds per viewer

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Start a game and verify it appears in active sessions
- [ ] Check avatar displays correctly (or fallback)
- [ ] Verify score updates in session list
- [ ] Confirm time remaining decreases
- [ ] Test multiple simultaneous games in same server
- [ ] Click session to join/spectate
- [ ] Verify session disappears when game ends
- [ ] Test with no active sessions (empty state)
- [ ] Confirm real-time updates work
- [ ] Test with Discord integration (when available)

### Database Verification:
```sql
-- View all active sessions
SELECT player_name, score, time_remaining, round_number, created_at
FROM game_sessions
WHERE game_status = 'active'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- View sessions by server
SELECT player_name, score, time_remaining
FROM game_sessions
WHERE server_id = 'dev-server-123' AND game_status = 'active';

-- Check completed sessions
SELECT player_name, score, words_found
FROM game_sessions
WHERE game_status = 'completed'
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
