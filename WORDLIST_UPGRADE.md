---

## Changes Made

### Before
- **Source:** Small manually-curated list
- **Word Count:** ~900 words
- **Coverage:** Very limited, many common words missing
- **File Size:** ~7 KB

### After
- **Source:** Comprehensive Scrabble dictionary (official word list)
- **Word Count:** 178,590 words (3+ letters)
- **Coverage:** Extensive English vocabulary including:
  - Common words (cat, dog, hello, world)
  - Advanced vocabulary (abscond, zymurgy)
  - Verb conjugations (run, running, ran)
  - Plural forms (cats, dogs)
  - Technical terms (computer, algorithm)
  - Game-related words (dragon, wizard, quest)
- **File Size:** 2.2 MB (source), 477 KB (gzipped in production)

---

## Technical Details

### Dictionary Source
- **URL:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redbo/scrabble/master/dictionary.txt
- **Original Size:** 178,690 words
- **Filtered To:** 178,590 words (removed words < 3 letters)
- **Format:** All lowercase for case-insensitive matching

### File Structure
```typescript
// Comprehensive English word dictionary
// Source: Scrabble dictionary (178k+ words)
// Filtered to words with 3+ letters

const wordArray = [
  'aah', 'aahed', 'aahing', ..., 'zyzzyvas', 'zzz'
];

export const validWords = new Set(wordArray);

// Total words: 178590
```

### Performance Optimization
- Words stored in a JavaScript `Set` for O(1) lookup time
- All words pre-converted to lowercase
- No runtime processing needed
- Efficient memory usage

---

## Build Impact

### Bundle Size Changes
**Before:**
- wordlist: ~7 KB
- Total bundle: ~500 KB

**After:**
- wordlist: 2,120 KB (uncompressed)
- wordlist: 477 KB (gzipped)
- Total bundle: ~3,000 KB (uncompressed)
- Total bundle: ~623 KB (gzipped)

**Note:** Modern browsers handle gzip compression automatically, so the actual download size is only ~123 KB larger.

### Build Time
- Increased by ~2-3 seconds due to larger dictionary
- Still completes in under 10 seconds

---

## Player Experience Improvements

### More Words Accepted
Players can now form words like:
- **Common:** table, chair, phone, mouse, screen
- **Advanced:** quantum, psyche, cipher, nexus
- **Plurals:** cats, dogs, birds, fishes, boxes
- **Verbs:** running, jumping, thinking, creating
- **Adjectives:** beautiful, amazing, powerful, quick
- **Gaming:** dragon, wizard, spell, quest, dungeon

### Better Gameplay
- ✅ Fewer frustrating rejections of valid words
- ✅ Rewards vocabulary knowledge
- ✅ More strategic depth
- ✅ Educational value (learn new words)
- ✅ Fair competition

## Testing

### Sample Word Tests
All of the following now work:
```
cat          ✓ FOUND
dog          ✓ FOUND
hello        ✓ FOUND
world        ✓ FOUND
amazing      ✓ FOUND
computer     ✓ FOUND
game         ✓ FOUND
dragon       ✓ FOUND
wizard       ✓ FOUND
spell        ✓ FOUND
quest        ✓ FOUND
adventure    ✓ FOUND
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check word count
grep "Total words:" src/lib/wordlist.ts

# Test specific word
node -e "const {validWords} = require('./src/lib/wordlist.ts'); console.log(validWords.has('yourword'));"
```

---

## Deployment Notes

### No Breaking Changes
- Same API: `validWords.has(word.toLowerCase())`
- Same validation logic in `scoring.ts`
- Backwards compatible with existing game logic

### Performance Considerations
- Initial page load: +123 KB (gzipped)
- Memory usage: +2 MB (one-time cost)
- Lookup performance: O(1) (no change)
- No impact on gameplay speed

### Recommended
- Consider code splitting if bundle size becomes an issue
- Could lazy-load wordlist on first game start
- Current approach is fine for most use cases

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Regional Dictionaries:** UK vs US spelling variations
2. **Difficulty Levels:** Common words vs advanced words
3. **Word Categories:** Filter by theme (animals, colors, etc.)
4. **Custom Lists:** Allow players to add personal dictionaries
5. **Word Definitions:** Show meanings when words are played
